MLPerf Benchmarks Tests

This repository collects performance tests based on [MLPerf training benchmarks](https://mlperf.org/training-overview/#overview). Each benchmark measures 
the wallclock time required to train a model on the specified dataset to achieve the specified quality target. 
The tests are optimized for NVIDIA CUDA-X software stack running on NVIDIA Volta GPUs.

The deep learning models implementation is taken from [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples).
